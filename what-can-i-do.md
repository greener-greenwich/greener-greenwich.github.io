## The quick and easy

* Swap your light bulbs for **LED light bulbs**. They are a bit more expensive to buy but they last much longer and they use much less electricity.
* Turn the heating down to 20 degrees; save on your heating bill and make a large impact on your household’s emissions.
* Check out our [Take Action](/blog) blog for links to open **petitions** demanding change.
* Save your leftovers and **reduce food waste** 
* Follow the **buyerarchy of needs** as proposed and illustrated by [Sarah Lazarovic](https://www.sarahl.com/) to combat our brains desire to want more. Everything we buy needs energy to be produced and transported. The less we buy, the less CO2 is released.​
* **Shop locally and waste free** - Greenwich has just gotten a great new waste free shop and local farmers markets offer a great selection on seasonal fruit and veg year round

## Getting around

* **Walk, cycle or take public transport** whenever you can
* Cut back on **air travel** - maybe consider staycations or overnight trains to continental Europe 
* If your family has to have a car, look into buying an **electric car**

## Big impacts and long term changes

* Get social and **join a local group** like XR, Eltham Enviros​, Stop the Silvertown Tunnel and meet new friends with a similar interest in saving the planet

* **Lobby your councillors** - see how here
* Try to **stay closer to home for your holidays**, somewhere you could go by train and cut down on air travel
