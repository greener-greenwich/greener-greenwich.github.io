The Greener Greenwich Community Network is a network of local Greenwich environmental groups and residents working together to make the Royal Borough of Greenwich greener.

We are holding Greenwich Council accountable for delivering their ambition of zero carbon by 2030.

We collaborate on community eco activisim through different groups, local actions and meetings to contribute to reducing carbon within the borough.
