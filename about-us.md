The aim of the Greenwich Climate Network is to provide a more coordinated local approach to scrutinising, working with and holding Greenwich Council to account for delivering successfully against its stated ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030.

Practically this includes attendance at relevant public meetings; review of written protocols, strategies and plans; preparing briefings ahead of key meetings; and developing regular progress reports accessible to Greenwich residents, groups and businesses. 

The network operates on the basis that a well-coordinated, cross local organisation, sustained constructive dialogue with the Council is an effective means of doing this. This dialogue will be both supportive and challenging in nature.

## Background

In June 2019 Greenwich Council passed a unanimous motion declaring a Climate Emergency at its Full Council meeting. A key part of that motion was to: ‘Deliver a Greenwich Carbon Neutral Plan, detailing how the Council’s pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030 will be achieved.’ In January 2020 the Council published its Carbon Neutral Plan Evidence Base and in early 2021 carried out a consultation on the Carbon Neutral Plan.

## Why the network exists?

Local organisations play a key role in reviewing and working with the Council on its approach to delivering its Carbon Neutral Plan in a way that has a meaningful and lasting impact on carbon emissions in the Borough.

### Intelligent information sharing

The network provide a way of sharing information in a timely and effective fashion across different local organisations to enable effective engagement with the council.

### Facilitating dialogue and coordination

Local groups will have different priorities and goals for engaging with the council and the network will provide a means of dialogue for those wishing to engage with the Council in a supportive but challenging way.

### Pooled resources & stronger voices

The network will increase the ability for local groups to do research by utilising the expertise from each participating member and for groups of similar goals to collaborate and amplify their voices.
