# Lobbying


Working with the council is a great way to affect change in your local community, but where to start, is their climate action plan any good and whom should you approach? These and many more excellent questions we have tried to address here.

If you've never lobbied a council before have a look in [The Basics](/lobbying-basics) for an introduction on the council setup, wards and a bit of a who's who.

We are not experts, but on this [Tips](/lobbying-tips) page can be found on how to raise an issue, follow-ups, preparing for meetings with the councilors, based on our own experiences.

For information on open petitions please go to [Take action](/blog).

Finding the councils homepage slightly confusing and can't find what you're looking for, check out [Resources](/lobbying-resources) for links to specific council webpages on various subjects, as well as links to materials available from other websites.
